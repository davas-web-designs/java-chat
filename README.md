# Java chat
### This is an exercise to demonstrate the knowledge on the java programming language I have acquired so far as well as to learn new concepts such as sockets or how I personally like to referr to this functionality, networking.

1. This chat starts as a simple application where we learn the fundamentals of networking and achieve the communication between two applications, one that acts like a server and another one as the client. The first steps we take are simple as we just get to show in the server what is send in the client. We can do this with the help of the Socket class built in in java.
2. Next up we get to describe a more atractive design, which is made up of several clients that inteeract with each other, always with the server in the middle.
3. We finally got to the point where we are able to communicate between two separate machines naturally via the chat. Technically, we needed to set a ServerSocket in the client so that it is always listening to what the server sends, as it replicates the information and sends it to the specified ip address. I also needed to set up several machines to be able to run the application and it wasnt an easy job as I chose to pick several different physical machones, virtual ones...cross os...but men, what a feeling when it finally worked!
